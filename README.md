Aim is to learn how to make D3 visualisations without using D3 dom manipulation bt making use of Vue components.

Based on following codepen -> https://codepen.io/terrymun/pen/gmBdKq

Will initaly try to recreate the above as a Vue cli project and then take what I have learnt and try to recreate this D3 viz -> http://bl.ocks.org/dougdowson/9832019
